# Introduction #
Practice# is a tool for practicing a musical instrument with playback music.
Basically it is an audio player that allows changing tempo (i.e. speed) and pitch in real time.

Use it daily and it will turn your playing skills sharper!

Practice# can be used for:
  * Practicing a musical instrument (e.g. Guitar, singing) with playback music. For example: Repeating a slowed down complex solo part until you perfect it.
  * Listening to pod casts - slower or faster than the original tempo and/or with a different pitch (higher or lower voice).

Practice# was designed as a practical tool, therefore it is minimalistic and doesn't have features that would bloat it.
There are minimal menus, two dialog windows (one of them is the About dialog), and in general all possible actions are shown on the main screen in an intuitive and direct way.
Keyboard shortcuts allow even easier and immediate control, than using a mouse.

# Features #
  * Playback of the following formats:
> > MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC
  * Speed change - The ability to slow down or speed up music without changing its pitch
  * Pitch change - The ability to change the pitch of music up or down without changing its speed. New! (1.4.6) - Accurate half semi-tone increments
  * Loops - Start and End Marker with Cue (waiting a few seconds before the loop starts, useful to get hands back into position)
  * Persistent Presets - The biggest difference currently between Practice# and the other tools out there. In fact, that is why this tool was written by me in the first place.
When you practice some song over and over for a while it is extremely useful to have some presets of your practice habits for this song.
For example: One preset can be for the intro and one for the verse or two presets can be for the solo - one regular speed and one slowed down to 75% with a cue of 2 seconds.
  * Cross Windows Platform - Runs on all latest Windows Operating systems, Tested on Windows XP Pro SP3 32 bit, Vista Home Premium 32 Bit & Windows 7 Pro 64 bit.
  * 3 Band Equalizer
  * New! (1.4.6) - Voice Suppression
